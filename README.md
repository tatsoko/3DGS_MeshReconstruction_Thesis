# Mesh Reconstruction from 3D Gaussian Splatting

This repository contains the implementation of **Mesh Reconstruction from 3D Gaussian Splatting**, a master's thesis project that reconstructs explicit 3D mesh surfaces from 3D Gaussians by combining:
- **GaussianShader**'s physically-based appearance modeling
- **RaDe-GS**'s differentiable rasterization and geometric regularization

The method uses a hybrid 3D Gaussian representation as a surface prior and optimizes it for photo-consistency, normal fidelity, and mesh extractability.

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

Introduces a differentiable pipeline for:
1. Optimizing Gaussian parameters (position, scale, rotation, BRDF appearance, opacity) from multi-view images.
2. Rendering views using closed-form splatting and physically-based shading.
3. Extracting high-quality triangle meshes by projecting optimized Gaussians into a tetrahedral field and running Marching Tetrahedra.
